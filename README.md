# Portfolio
This is a repository with all data analysis projects that I am able to share. Some of them I have completed during my education at "Yandex Practicum" as an Data Analyst. Each folder contains one or more jupyter notebooks as well as a README file with description of the project, conclusions, description of data used, as well as a list of python libraries and tools used in that project.

Note: the projects present mostly contain text in <ins>RUSSIAN</ins> language, and are present to showcase coding and analytical skills.
