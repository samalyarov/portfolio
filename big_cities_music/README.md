# Description:
Moscow and Saint-Petersburg are cities with a lot of myths and prejudicies about them:
- Moscow is a metropolis, whose heart beats in a very strict working rhythm, a city of haste and efficiency.
- Saint P is a city of culture, unique and unlike any other.
Some myths do represent reality. Others - are empty words and stories. In order to make rational decisions, businesses ought to distinguish the former from the latter. Using the data from Yandex.Music (one of the biggest CIS music-platforms) we will determine if there is a difference between how people from those cities listen to music and if there is - what is that difference.

# Data
- Track name
- Band|Performer name
- Genre
- City
- Day (logged)
- Timestamp (logged)

# Research goal â€” to test several hypotheses:
1. User activity depends on what day of week it is. In addition to general difference - patterns are different in Moscow and Saint P.
2. Monday mornings and friday evenings are vastly different in two cities (in regards to music preferences, of course).
3. Genre preferences are different in two cities - denizens of Moscow prefer pop, while those living in Saint P prefer russian rap.

# Conclusions:
1. Day of the week impacts citizens of Moscow and Saint P differently indeed. Thus, first hypothesis was confirmed.
2. Musical preferences generally don't change much throughout the week. There are, however, certain differences between the cities on mondays: Moscow-based users prefer the music of "world" genre, while people in Saint P prefer jazz and classical music. The second hypothesis is only partially confirmed, as there are several factors that potentially could have impacted the outcome.
3. There are many more similarities betwwen musical tastes of people in two cities, then there are differences - the third hypothesis was not confirmed.
